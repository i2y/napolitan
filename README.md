# Napolitan

Napolitan is a lightweight, user-friendly library for creating custom elements with a simple API for PyScript. It uses a declarative approach for easy component structure definition and updates only changed parts of the DOM for efficiency. It works with both Pyodide and MicroPython, using only the language features and built-in libraries supported by both, intentionally avoiding certain modules like typing and metaclasses. Based on Web Components, probably, Napolitan works with any PyScript, JavaScript, or TypeScript framework.

Doucumentation is available at [here](https://i2y.github.io/napolitan/), but it is under construction.
For now, if you want to know more about Napolitan, please refer to the examples in the `examples` directory.
